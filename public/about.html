<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Connie, I am based in London, England, which is where I was born and raised. I love to sit in front of a computer screen for hours, if not days, on end. I love to solve problems and I am crazy about coding! Sinking my teeth into a juicy web development project is my idea of heaven.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed browsing the websites I have created so far. I'm excited to collaborate with you! Please do contact me by phone or email so that we can discuss your idea and how we can make it happen!</p>
